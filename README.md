# Folder Structure Setup

Let's create the following folder structure:

```sh
PLAYWRIGHT/

## Quick Check

1. In the `playwright.config.ts` file, comment out all other browsers and ensure only `chromium` is enabled.

2. Run the following command to verify everything still works:

```sh
npx playwright test --headed
```

If tests execute successfully, you're all set!

🎯 The target project structure is now set up. Let’s keep moving forward... 🚀
